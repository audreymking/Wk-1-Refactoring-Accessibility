# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Refactoring and Accessibility 

The main goal of this homework was to refactor (modify existing body of code withought changing the overall look of the website) to improve the code for future use. The marketing agency's main focus was to improve SEO and accessibility of their webpage without changing the look.

## Modifiying HTML

To improve the HTML:
* alt tags were added to images
* changed "div" tags
* added comments for future use
* changed title

## Modifying CSS
* added comments for future use
* condensed CSS selectors for easier visibility
* changed elements to match changed "div" tags
